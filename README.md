A demonstration of how to use the SANE stack by Markus Padourek https://github.com/artificialio/sane

Currently, in its very beginning, this repo will soon include a set of features similar to my pre-Ember-CLI and pre-Sails.js learning project https://github.com/mgenev/nodember. You can check its readme out to see the direction I'm heading in.

Unlike Nodember, which was never production ready, thanks to the hard work in the right direction being done for SANE, this project will be production ready and follow best practices.
